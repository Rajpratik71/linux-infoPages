     application.
   * Replaced some of the images for the inspectors.
   * Corrected the following bugs since the last release: #16049,

2.16 Noteworthy changes in version '1.0.2'
==========================================

This is a bugfix release.

   * Fixed some bugs with table column selection.
   * Corrected a minor problem in the custom class inspector.

2.17 Noteworthy changes in version '1.0.0'
==========================================

PLEASE NOTE: This version of Gorm requires base 1.11.1 and gui 0.10.1 to
be installed (gnustep-startup-0.13.0).

   * All inspectors are now modeled in .gorm files.
   * Added autosizing to form attributes inspector.
   * Utilize and maintain parent/child data structure more pervasively
   * Reorganized code in palettes for cleaner implementation.
   * Removed code to check for user bundles, since bugs in Camaelon
     which prompted those changes were fixed long ago.
   * Added documentation to GormCore

2.18 Noteworthy changes in version '0.11.0'
===========================================

   * Improved implementation of canSubstituteForClass: the default
     implementation of this method tests the classes to see if
     initWithCoder: or encodeWithCoder: is implemented on a subclass to
     determine automatically if that class has the same encoding
     signature as the original class, if it does, it can be substituted.
   * Improved handling of classes which use cell classes in the custom
     class inspector.  The inspector now autmatically replaces the cell
     class with the appropriate one when the user selects a given
     subclass.
   * Browser based class editor in document panel.  This interface is
     more like the one on OSX. The user now has a choice in preferences
     to determine which view they would like to use.
   * Translation tools.  The Document->Translate menu allows the user to
     export string and import strings in the strings format, so that
     someone can easily translate just the strings in the file and
     doesn't need to directly edit anything in Gorm.  The strings file
     can then be loaded back into Gorm and all of the relevant strings
     are updated.
   * Alignment tools.  In the new Layout menu there are options to align
     views, center views, bring views to front or push them to the back
     of the view layers.
   * Implementation of IBViewResourceDraggingDelegate.  This allows
     updating of the pull down in the inspectors panel dynamically.  It
     requires the developer of a palette to implement some code to
     enable this, as on OSX.
   * Lots of bugfixes and usability changes are also included in this
     release.

2.19 Noteworthy changes in version '0.9.10'
===========================================

   * Gorm now has a full implementation of canSubstituteForClass: which
     is used to determine if a class can be substituted in the custom
     class inspector.  This allows classes added in palettes to say
     whether or not they can be used as a subsitute for a kit class.
   * Better separation of Gorm into libraries.  As well as the ability
     to compile on windows with a simple: "make install"
   * Implementation of IBResourceManager class.  This class is used by
     palettes to register drag types to be considered by the top level
     editors in the document window: object, sound, image, class.
   * Gorm now is able to switch views in the document window when you
     drag a file into it.  If it's an image it will switch to the image
     view, if it's a sound, the sound view, an object the object view
     etc or if it's a class (a .h file) it will switch to the classes
     view.
   * Drag and drop parsing of header files (if you hadn't gathered from
     the previous item).
   * Better support for standalone views.  while the user cannot
     instantiate from the classes view (there were too many problems
     with this approach).  They can now drag any view from the palette
     into the objects view and have it work.
   * A myriad of bug fixes.

2.20 Noteworthy changes in version '0.9.2'
==========================================

NOTE: This is mainly a bugfix release.

   * Some improvements to the procedure for removing connections.
   * Corrected various issues with header parsing.
   * Now closes windows which were opened during interface testing such
     as font panels, info panels, etc.
   * Minor corrections to background color for a number of inspectors.
   * Improvements to gmodel importation.
   * Better detection of when the user is utilizing a user bundle.  Gorm
     will now warn the user with a panel.
   * Various improvements in documentation

2.21 Noteworthy changes in version '0.9.0'
==========================================

   * Images/Sounds can now be dragged into a matrix cell.
   * Fully implemented date and number formatter inspectors (these
     classes still need work in GUI).
   * Added warning panel if the user attempts to edit a .gorm file
     created with a newer version of Gorm
   * Modified data.classes format so that only those actions
     specifically added to FirstResponder are listed.
   * Greatly improved gmodel importation.  (experimental)
   * It's now possible to add methods to classes which are not custom.
     This allows the user to add actions which may have been added to
     those classes by categories.
   * Completely new header parser implemented.
   * Improved cut/paste.  It's now possible to use cut/paste from almost
     anywhere.  The class editor now fully supports it.
   * Improved implementation of some of the InterfaceBuilder framework
     classes.
   * Object editor will now remove all instances of a class that has
     been deleted from the class editor.
   * The class inspector and the classes view will now apply stricter
     rules to names of actions and outlets to ensure that they are
     properly entered.
   * All inspectors work perfectly with customized colors.
   * Fixed a number of bugs.

2.22 Noteworthy changes in version '0.8.0'
==========================================

PLEASE NOTE: It is important for this release that you upgrade to Gorm
0.8.0 when using Gorm with the new GNUstep libraries (base-1.10.0 and
gui-0.9.4).  This version of Gorm contains some features which are
reliant on changes made in those versions of the libraries.  It is
stated in Gorm's documentation (the Gorm.texi file) that this is
required, but I felt it important enough to also mention it here so that
it is known beyond a reasonable doubt.

   * New gorm file version.
   * Full custom palette support
   * Palette preferences panel to allow the user to configure palettes
     to load
   * Experimental: Standalone views.  This feature is to allow the use
     of a view without the need of a containing window.  This allows
     developers to treat these views as they would any other top level
     object in the .gorm file.  This is experimental functionality.
   * Improved NSTableColumn inspector.  The new inspector allows the
     user to change the data cell used for a given column.  This allows
     the user to select from a list of cell subclasses and set the
     appropriate custom or non-custom one they want to appear in that
     column of the table.
   * Improved layout of some of the inspectors.
   * Removed old class parser.  The parser was somewhat buggy and was
     actually causing some issues.  A new parser will be available in
     the next version of Gorm.  For now users will need to use the class
     inspector or the outline view to enter classes into Gorm.
   * Experimental: "File" section.  This is essentially a per-file
     preference which allows the user to control which version of
     GNUstep a given file will be compatible with.  It also lists the
     potential compatibility issues with the selected version.
   * Improved controls palette.  New items for some of the standard font
     replace the old "Title" widget which was a System-14 font.  The new
     widgets use a selection of the standard System font to allow the
     user to easily build a gui using these and reducing the amount of
     time the user needs to spend fiddling with the font panel.

2.23 Noteworthy changes in version '0.7.7'
==========================================

   * Important bugfixes in editor classes.
   * Rearranged some of the editor classes to be in the palettes which
     contain the classes they are responsible for editing
     (GormButtonEditor & GormTabViewEditor).
   * Image and Sound editors will now display system default images or
     sounds if they are available.
   * Document window now uses an NSToolbar (experimental).
   * Improved the layout of some of the inspectors.
   * Corrected some minor issues in the inspectors
   * Added code to allow NSTableView and NSOutlineView to show some data
     during testing
   * Gorm will now show an alert panel when a model fails to load or
     test properly.

2.24 Noteworthy changes in version '0.7.6'
==========================================

This release is mainly a bugfix release for 0.7.5.

   * Improved .gmodel support
   * Corrections to previous repair feature.
   * Important bugfixes for Menu editing.
   * Important bugfixes for class inspector.

2.25 Noteworthy changes in version '0.7.5'
==========================================

   * The 'reparent' feature in the class inspector.  This allows the
     user to change the class hierarchy from within Gorm.
   * Some important bugfixes
   * a property 'GormRepairFileOnLoad' (untested) which should repaire
     old .gorm files...  It is HIGHLY recommended that Gorm not be run
     with this on constantly and that you back up any files which you
     want to repair before opening them with this option turned on.
   * A shelf inspector in prefs that lets you expand the size of the
     names in the object view..
   * Support for NSFontManager
   * A way to restore a complete NSMenu if it's deleted (a new palette
     entry for NSMenu, not just an item)

2.26 Noteworthy changes in version '0.6.0'
==========================================

   * Several major bugs corrected.
   * Clarified some of the inspectors
   * Menu items are now properly enabled/disabled when appropriate
   * More descriptive title displayed when a class is being edited.

2.27 Noteworthy changes in version '0.5.0'
==========================================

   * Enabled defer in NSWindow inspector.
   * Added code to the connection inspector to prevent erroneous
     connections.
   * Added support for upgrading of old .gorm files using the older
     template mechanism
   * Grouping with an NSSplitView now operates using the relative
     positions of the views in the window.
   * Custom Class inspector now shows all subclasses, not just direct
     custom subclasses.
   * Bug fixes, eliminated memory leak, code cleanup, etc.

2.28 Noteworthy changes in version '0.4.0'
==========================================

   * New Menu and Menu Item inspectors.
   * User can now specify the Services and Windows menus in the menu
     inspector.
   * User can specify a non-custom subclass as well as a custom one to
     replace the class when the .gorm is unarchived.  This can be used
     to turn a NSTextField into NSSecureTextField and etc.
   * New set name panel.
   * New switch control on the font panel to allow the user to specify
     if a font is encoded with its default size or not.
   * Added NSStepper and NSStepperCell to the class list to allow
     creation of custom subclasses.
   * Windows and Services menus now function correctly.

2.29 Noteworthy changes in version '0.3.1'
==========================================

   * New custom class system.
   * Images now persist correctly when added to a button or view.
   * Fixed DND
   * Various bugfixes

2.30 Noteworthy changes in version '0.3.0'
==========================================

   * Preferences added.
   * User can now enable and disable guidlines for easier editing.
   * Refactored code into GormLib which is a clone of the
     InterfaceBuilder framework.  This facilitates creating palettes and
     inspectors outside of Gorm.
   * Added class inspector for easier editing of classes.  This gives
     the user the option to use either the outline view or the inspector
     to edit new classes.
   * Added inspectors for the following: NSScrollView,
     NSProgressIndicator, NSColorWell, GormImageInspector (for images
     added to .gorm files).
   * Improved look of NSTabView inspector.
   * Removed all warnings from the code.
   * various bug fixes.

2.31 Noteworthy changes in version '0.2.5'.
===========================================

Many fixes and improvements to make the app work better.

   * Better parsing of headers
   * Interface code redone as gorm files.
   * Re-add multiple selection via mouse drag.

2.32 Noteworthy changes in version '0.2.0' snapshot.

     editing.
   * Improved test mode support.
   * Improved drag n' drop support on many items.
   * Intelligent placement hints.
   * Read gmodel files.
   * More inspectors.
   * Sound and Image support.
   * gorm files were changed to directory wrappers for more flexibility.

2.33 Noteworthy changes in version '0.1.0'

     matrices and/or increase decrease rows and cols.
   * Edit NSForms titles in place.
   * Edit NSBoxes and add subviews.
   * Support for custom objects.

2.35 Noteworthy changes in version '0.0.2'
==========================================

   * Add popup and pulldown menu controls
   * Menu support
   * More inspectors
   * Some support for connections
   * Much more fleshed out - too numerous to mention.

2.36 Noteworthy changes in version '0.0.1'
==========================================

   * 8th December 1999

        * Save/Load 'nib' documents (binary archived data)

          This works so far as it can be tested - but that's just
          archives containing windows or panels so far.

        * Load palettes

          Loading of palettes works.  You can load palettes from the
          'Tools' menu.  Gorm automatically loads all the palettes from
          its Resources directory.

        * Basic framework

          So far, the app provides a basic framework that needs fleshing
          out.
             * It has a palettes manager object that allows you to
               select a palette and drag items from the palette into
               your document.

             * It has a special per-document editor object, which keeps
               track of a matrix of icons representing the top-level
               objects in the document.

             * It has an inspector manager class, which updates the
               inspector panel when the selected object is changed by an
               editor.

             * It has special inspectors for handling an empty selection
               or a multiple selection.

        * Palettes

          Four palettes (three of which are empty at present) are built
          and installed in the apps Resources directory.

          The Window palette is more fully fleshed out than the other
          palettes.  It permits windows and panels to be created in
          Gorm.  If provides the start of a window attributes inspector.

   * 18 December 1999

        * You can drag views from a palette into a window or panel.
        * You can select views in a window by clicking on them,
          shift-clicking (for multiple selection), or click-drag on the
          window background to select views in a box.
        * You can delete/cut/copy/paste views betwen windows.
        * You can move views in a window by clicking on them and
          dragging.
        * You can resize views by clicking on their knobs and dragging.
        * You can control-drag to mark source and destination views for
          a connection.

        * Next task - inspectors.

          The connection inspector needs to be implemented to complete
          the process of establishing connections.  The size inspector
          needs to be implemented to set autosizing parameters for a
          view.

          Once these are done, the object editor needs to be made to
          support connections so that we can connect between objects
          other than views, then we need to write a menu editor.

   * 22 December 1999

        * Connections inspector is now working - but it needs some
          effort to tidy it up.
        * Class info (outlets and actions) is specified in
          'ClassInformation.plist' and needs to be present so that the
          app knows what outlets/actions an object has (and therefore
          what connections can be made).

        * The view size inspector is working - allowing you to set the
          size of the subviews within a window.

        * The attributes inspector for 'FilesOwner' is working, so you
          can define the class of the files owner (it defaults to
          NSApplication).

        * There is a crude panel for setting the name of the selected
          object.

        * I've created a couple of new images and got rid of the two
          NeXT images that were lurking in there.

        * There is a Testing directory, with a GormTest application that
          lets you load a nib for testing - it assumes that the nib will
          set its FilesOwners delegate to point to a window, and makes
          that window the key window ...

   * 23 December 1999

     Last work before christmas ...

     Various bits of tidying up plus -

     Added an evil hack of a generic attributes inspector ...  This
     looks through all the methods of the selected object to find those
     taking a single argument and beginning with 'set'.  It makes all
     these setting methods (whose argument is a simple scalar type or an
     object) available for you to invoke from the inspector panel.

     This makes it possible to set pretty much any attribute of any
     object, but you do need to have the GNUstep header files to hand,
     so you can tell what numeric values to enter to achieve a desired
     result.

3 Overview
**********

Gorm is an application for creating the user interface (and possibly
entire applications) for a GNUstep application.  Initially a close clone
of the old NeXTstep 3.3 Interface Builder application, I expect that
Gorm will mutate beyond the capabilities of that app.

   GNUstep is an object-oriented programming framework and a collection
of tools developed for or using the GNUstep libraries.

   You can find out more about GNUstep at <http://www.gnustep.org>

   The basic idea behind Gorm is simple - it provides a graphical user
interface with which to connect together objects from the GNUstep
libraries (as well as custom-written objects) and set their attributes
in an easy to use manner.

   The collection of objects is then saved as a document which can
either be re-loaded into Gorm for further editing, or can be loaded into
a running GNUstep application in order to provide that application with
a user interface or some subsystem.

4 Usage
*******

Here is a description of the menu structure and what each menu does -

   * Info
     The 'Info' menu item produces a submenu ...
        * Info Panel
          A panel giving very limited information about Gorm
        * Preferences
          A panel allowing you to set preferences about how Gorm
          operates

          A panel providing general help on using Gorm

   * Document
     The 'Document' menu item produces a submenu ...
        * Open
          This produces an open panel that lets you open a Gorm
          document.  You use this if you want to use Gorm to edit an
          exisiting document.
        * New Application
          This creates a new application document within Gorm, you may
          then use the Palettes panel to drag new objects into the
          document.
        * New Module
          Contains a submenu, which also contains:

             * New Empty
               produces an empty document with only NSFirst and NSOwner.
             * New Inspector
               produces a document with NSOwner, NSFirst and a window
               which is the correct size for an Inspector.
             * New Palette
               produces a document which is like the one by 'New
               Inspector', but it's window is the right size for a
               Palette.

        * Save
          This saves the current document
        * Save As
          This saves the current document to a new file and changes the
          document name to match the new name on disk.
        * Save All
          This saves all documents currently being edited by Gorm.
        * Revert To Saved
          This removes all changes made to the document sunce the last
          save, or since the document was opened.
        * Test Interface
          This provides interactive testing of the active document.  To
          end testing, you need to select the 'quit' menu item.

               translate.
             * Export Strings
               Export a strings file.  TODO

        * Miniaturize
          This miniaturises the active document (or whatever panel is
          currently key).
        * Close
          This closes the currenly active document.
        * Debug
          Prints some useful internal information.

          Which produces a submenu
             * In Splitview
               Groups views into an NSSplitView.  Gorm does this based
               on the relative positions of the views being grouped.  It
               determines the orientation and the order of th views and
               then groups them either vertically or horizontally in the
               order they appear on the screen.

5.1 Notes on implementation
===========================

The IB documentation on how object selection is managed and how editors
and inspectors are used is unclear ...  so I've gone my own way.

   1.  When a document is loaded, the document object creates an editor
attached to each top-level object in the user interface (NSMenu and
NSWindow objects).

   These editors must be aware of their edited objects being clicked
upon, and clicking on one of these should cause the corresponding editor
to become the active editor.

   The active editor is responsible for handling selection of the edited
object (and any objects below it in the object hierarchy).  Upon change
of selection, the editor is responsible for sending an
IBSelectionChangedNotification with the selection owner (normally the
editor itsself) as the notification owner.

   The main application watches for these notifications in order to keep
track of who has the selection.

5.2 Connections
===============

The connection API is the same as that for IB, but with the extension
that the document object must implement [-windowAndRect:forObject:] to
return the window in which the object is being displayed, and the
rectangle enclosing the object (in window base coordinates).

   This information is needed by Gorm so that it can mark the
connection.

   The editors mananging the drag-and-drop operation for a connection
must call '[NSApp -displayConnectionBetween:and:]' to tell Gorm to
update its display.  This method sets the values currently returned by
'[NSApp -connectSource]' and '[NSApp -connectDestination]'.

6 Preferences
*************

The preferences panel contains a number of useful customizable options
which can be used to modify the behavior of Gorm.

   Some of these defaults can be safely modified from the command line
by the user.

   * PreloadHeaders
     The user can define a set of headers to load when Gorm starts
     creation of a new .gorm file.  This is useful when the user is
     building a framework or a set of interfaces for a large
     application.

   * ShowInspectors
     Controls whether the inspector shows when Gorm is started.

   * ShowPalettes
     Controls whether the palettes window shows when Gorm is started.

   * BackupFile
     Determines if the old .gorm is moved to .gorm~ when the modified
     version is saved.
   * AllowUserBundles
     If the user sets this to YES, they will still get a warning, but
     Gorm won't quit.

7 Basic Concepts
****************

This chapter will explain some of the basic things you need to
understand before starting work on a new application.

7.1 Getting Started
===================

First you need to understand a few basic concepts.  Gorm's main window
includes a few standard entries which must be explained before we can
proceed.

   They are:

   * NSOwner

   * NSFirst

   * NSFont

7.2 What is NSOwner?
====================

NSOwner is the class which "owns" the interface.  This is, by default,
NSApplication, but it can be any class you like.  You can change it by
selecting NSOwner in the document window and going to the "Custom Class"
inspector in the inspectors window.  From there, you should see all of
the classes which the NSOwner can assume.  We'll discuss more about this
later when we go over how to create a new application

7.3 What is NSFirst?
====================

NSFirst is your interface to the responder chain.  NSFirst is
representative of the current "first responder" in the application.
When you want a message, such as a changeFont: message, to go to the
current first responder from, say, a menu, you connect the menu item to
the NSFirst object in the document window.  By doing this, it means that
whichever object has first responder status at that time in the
application will become the reciever of the "changeFont:" message.

7.3.1 Responders
----------------

A responder is any subclass of NSResponder.  This includes NSWindow,
NSView and all of the NSControl subclasses.

7.3.2 The Responder Chain
-------------------------

The responder chain is a sequence of objects which are called to
determine where a message sent to the first responder will go.  A
message invoked on the first responder will be invoked on the first
object in the responder chain which responds to that message.

   The object which this message will be called on is determined in the
method [NSApplication targetForAction:].  The call sequence is as
follows, it will only proceed to the next step in each case if the
current step fails to respond to the message which was invoked:

   * The firstResponder of the keyWindow, if one exists.
   * Iterates through all responders by pulling each in the linked list
     of responders for the key window.
   * It then tries the keyWindow.
   * Then the keyWindow's delegate
   * if the application is document based it tries the document
     controller object for the key window.
   * then it tries the mainWindow's list of responders (as above)
   * the mainWindow's delegate
   * if the app is document based, it tries the document controller for
     the main window
   * and finally, it tries the NSApplication delegate.

   If all of the options in this list are exhausted, it then gives up
and returns nil for the object which is to respond.

7.4 What is NSFont?
===================

NSFont represents the NSFontManager object for the application.  This
object is a shared singleton.  This means that, for any given app, there
should be only one instance of the object.  This object is generally
added to the document window when another objec, such as a Font menu
item, is added to the interface, which, in turn, requires that this
object be added to the document.

7.5 The awakeFromNib method
===========================

This method is called on any custom object which is unarchived from a
nib/gorm file.  This method is called on all objects after the entire
archive has been loaded into memory and all connections have been made.
Given all of this, you should not make any assumptions at all about
which objects have been called and which have not.  You should not
release any objects in this method.

8 Creating an Application
*************************

If you have ProjectCenter, you need to open it and create an
"Application" project.  Create it with the name "FirstApp".  From there
you can open the MainMenu.gorm by clicking on interfaces and selecting
MainMenu.gorm.  If Gorm.app is properly installed, you Gorm should start
up.

   If you don't have ProjectCenter, you can create the Gorm file by
hand.  First you need to start Gorm.  You can either do this by doing
'gopen -a Gorm.app' from a command line prompt, or you can invoke it
from the Dock or from the workspace's file viewer.

   You then need to select the 'Document' menu, and then 'New
Application'.  This should produce a new document window, with a menu
and an empty window.  This should be the same as with the ProjectCenter
gorm file since this is the basic starting point for an application.

   For the sections below...  only do one or the other, not both.

8.1 Creating A Class In Gorm
============================

There are two ways to do this next operation.  I will take you through
each step by step.  First click on the classes icon in the toolbar on
the top of the Gorm document window.  You should see the view below
change to an outline view containing a list of class names.  Once this
happens we're ready to create a class.  Select the class you wish to
subclass in the outline view.  For our example we will use the simplest:
NSObject.  Select it by clicking on the class name once.  Then go to the
Classes menu in the main menu and select Create Subclass (you can also
type Alt-Shift-c, which will do this as well.  The new class will be
created in the list with the name "NewClass".

8.2 Using The Outline View
==========================

From here double click on the subclass name to make it editable.  Type
the name of the class and hit enter.  For our example, please use the
class name MyController.  When you hit enter an alert panel will appear
and warn you about breaking connections, simply select OK and continue.

   This method of inputting the classes was inspired by IB in OPENSTEP
4.2/Mach which had functionality very similar to this.  For users of
that the transition to Gorm will be seamless.

8.2.1 Adding Outlets In The Outline View
----------------------------------------

Too add an outlet, select the round icon with the two horizontal lines
in it (it sort of looks like a wall outlet.  This should become
depressed.  Here you need to go to the Gorm Menu, under Classes select
"Add Outlet/Action".  Each time you press this menu item another outlet
will be added with a name similar to newOutlet, as you add more the
number at the end will increase.  For now add only one outlet.

   To rename the outlet simply double click it and change it's name like
you did the class above to "value" for the sake of our example.

8.2.2 Adding Actions In the Outline View
----------------------------------------

The procedure to add on action is precisely the same as adding an
outlet, except you must click on the button which looks like a target (a
circle with a + inside).  Add an action and name it "buttonPressed:" for
the sake of our example.

8.3 Using The Class Edit Inspector
==================================

This way is much more inline with the "OPENSTEP/GNUstep" philosophy.
For each object there is an inspector, even for Class objects.

   Once you have created the class as described in the previous section
"Creating a Class In Gorm", you must skip to this section to use the
inspector.  In the Gorm main menu select Tools and then select
"Inspectors".  This will make certain that the inspectors window is
being displayed.  Once the inspectors window is up move the pulldown on
the top to "Attributes" and select the class you created which should,
at this point, have the name "NewClass".  You'll notice that the "Class"
field at the top which shows the name's background color has turned
white, instead of grey.  This indicates that this class name is
editable.  Erase "NewClass" from the text field and type "MyController".

8.3.1 Adding Outlets In The Inspector
-------------------------------------

Adding outlets is very intuitive in the inspector.  Simply select the
"Outlets" tab in the tab view and click "Add" to add more outlets, and
"Remove" to remove them.  For the sake of our example, add one outlet
and name it "value".

8.3.2 Adding Actions In the Inspector
-------------------------------------

Very much like above only with the "Actions" tab, add an action called
button pressed.

8.4 Instantiating The Class
===========================

In the Classes outline view select the new class you've created, now
called MyController and then go to the Gorm menu and select Classes, and
then Instantiate.  The document window should shift from the classes
view to the objects view.  Amoung the set of objects should be a new
object called MyController.

8.5 Adding Controls from the Palette
====================================

Go to the Gorm menu and select Tools, then Palettes.  This will bring
the palette window to the front.  The second palette from the left is
the "ControlsPalette".  Select that one and find the button object (it
should have the word "Button" in it).  Drag that to the window and drop
it anywhere you like.

   Repeat this operation with the text field.  It's the control with
"Text" in it.  We are now ready to start making connections between
different objects in the document.

8.5.1 Making Connections
------------------------

The type of application we are creating is known as a "NSApplication
delegate" this means that the MyController object will be set as the
delegate of NSApplication.

   To make this connection click on NSOwner and hold down the Control
button, keep it pressed as you drag from the NSOwner object to the
MyController object.  The inspectors window should change to the
Connections inspector and should show two outlets "delegate" and "menu".
Select the "delegate", at this point you should see a green S and a
purple T on the NSOwner and MyController objects respectively, and press
the "Connect" button in the inspector.  In the "Connections" section of
the inspector you should see an entry which looks similar to "delegate
(MyController)" this indicates that the connection has been made.

   Now we need to make connections from the controller to the textfield
and from the controller to the button.  Select the MyController object
and Control-Drag (as before) from the object to the text field, this
will make an outlet connection.  You should see the connections
inspector again, this time select the "value" outlet and hit Connect.

   Next, control-drag from the button to the controller, this will make
an action connection.  The connections inspector should again appear.
This time you need to select the "target" outlet, to get the list of
actions.  The list should have only one entry, which is "buttonPressed:"
since this is the one we added earlier.  Press Connect.  You should see
an entry like "buttonPressed: (MyController" in the Connections section
of the inspector.

   It is also possible to make this connection to NSFirst, but to keep
things simple, make it directly to the object.  If you make the
connection to buttonPressed: on NSFirst the functionality of the
application will be unchanged, but the invocation will take the path
described above in the section which describes "The Responder Chain".

8.6 Saving the gorm file
========================

At this point you must save the .gorm file.  Go to the Gorm menu and
click Documents and then select "Save".  If the document was opened from
a pre-existing .gorm, it will save to that same file name.  If it is an
UNTITLED .gorm file a file dialog will appear and you will need to
select the directory where you want to store the .gorm file and type the
name of the .gorm file.

8.7 Generating .h and .m files from the class.
==============================================

This is different than saving, some people have gotten this confused
with the idea of Gorm generating the code for the gui.  Gorm does
nothing of the sort (grin).

   Go to the Classes section in the Document window and select the
MyController class yet again.  Now go to the Gorm menu and select
Classes and the select "Create Class Files".  This will bring up a file
panel and it allow you to select the directory in which to put the
files.  It will first create the MyController.m file and then the
MyController.h file.  Simply select the directory in which your app will
reside and hit okay for both.  You can change the names, but the default
ones, which are based on the class name, should be sufficient.  When you
look at the .m for this class, you should see the 'buttonPressed:'
method with the commecnt '/* insert your code here */' in it.  Delete
this comment and add '[value setStringValue: @``Hello''];'.  The class
should look like this after you're done:

   /* All Rights reserved */

   #include <AppKit/AppKit.h>

   #include "MyController.h"

   @implementation MyController

   - (void) buttonPressed: (id)sender

   {

   [value setStringValue: @"Hello"];

   }

   @end

   You recall, we connected the textfield to the "value" variable.  The
call above causes the method setStringValue to be invoked on the
textfield you added to the window.

   Also, note that the name of the method is "buttonPressed:".  This is
the action which is bound to the button.  When it is pressed the text in
the textfield should change to "Hello".

   You now need to build the application either by copying in a
GNUmakefile and making the appropriate changes or by using
ProjectCenter's build capability, depending on if you use it or not.

   This app is available as "SimpleApp" in the Examples directory under
the Documentation directory distributed with Gorm.  Hopefully this has
helped to demonstrate, albeit on a small scale, the capabilities of
Gorm.  In later chapters we will cover more advanced application
architectures and topics.

9 Another Simple Application
****************************

This chapter will describe an application, very much like the previous
one, but using a slightly different structure.  This application builds
on the previous application and uses WinController as the NSOwner of the
app instead of making it the delegate of NSApplication.

9.1 Adding Menu Items
=====================

Select the first palette in the palette window, this should be the
MenusPalette.  The palette will have a bunch of pre-made menu items on
it that you can add.  We want to keep this simple, so grab the one
called "Item" and drag it over to the menu in main menu nib (the menu on
the screen, not the one in the objects view).  As you have this object
over the menu, the copy/paste mouse cursor should appear (it looks
something like one box over another box at a 45 degree angle).  Where
you drop the menu determines it's position in the menu.  You can always
drag it to a new position after you've placed it by simply selecting and
dragging up or down.  Once you've placed the menu item, double click on
the title and change it to "Open"

   You can also change the name in the NSMenuItem attributes inspector.
Now you must add openWindow: to MyController and make the connection
from the "Open" menu item to NSFirst.  In the connections inspector,
find the "openWindow:" action.  You could simply make the connection
directly, but this is an exaple to show you that this connection will
work as well.  Whichever object has First Responder status will be
tested to see if it responds to this method.

   The implementation for openWindow: in MyController should simply be:

   - (void) openWindow: (id) sender

   {

   winController = [[WinController alloc] init];

   }

   Also add the winController attribute and an include to allow
WinController to be referenced in the MyController.m file.

9.2 Making a Controller-based .gorm file
========================================

Create a new .gorm file as described in the previous section using the
"New Module" menu item.  Under "New Module" select "New Empty".  This
should produce a .gorm file with only NSOwner and NSFirst.  From the
WindowsPalette (which should be the second palette in the palette
window) drag a window to the location where you want it to appear on the
screen.  In the window add a button called "Close".

   Go through the same steps you went through previously to create
MyController, except for adding the outlets/actions, but this time with
the name WinController.  Add an outlet called window and an action
called "closeWindow:".

   Now, instead of instantiating the class go back to the objects view
and select the NSOwner object.  After that select the "Custom Class"
inspector.  Look for the entry for WinController and select it.  You now
must connect the "window" outlet to the Window you added previously.

   Switch back to the objects view, then Control-Drag not to the window
on the screen, but to the window's representation in the objects view.
In the connection inspector select the window outlet and click Ok.

   Save the .gorm as using the name Controller.gorm in the project
directory.

   Generate the Controller.h and Controller.h files as described in the
previous section.

9.2.1 Add the init method to WinController
------------------------------------------

Add an implementation of the action "closeWindow:" to WinController and
also an init which loads the gorm/nib file and declares itself as the
owner.  Here's how:

   /* All Rights reserved */

   #include <AppKit/AppKit.h>

   #include "WinController.h"

   @implementation WinController

   - (id) init

   {

   if((self = [super init]) != nil)

   {

   if([NSBundle loadNibNamed: @"Controller" owner: self] == NO)

   {

   NSLog(@"Problem loading interface");

   return nil;

   }

   [window makeKeyAndOrderFront: self];

   }

   return self;

   }

   - (void) closeWindow: (id) sender {

   [window close];

   }

   - (void) dealloc { [super dealloc]; RELEASE(window); }

   @end

   The Controller gorm will be loaded and the connections will be made
to the current instance, i.e.  window will point to the window object
instantianted in the .gorm file and all actions declared in the .gorm
file which are attached to the object NSOwner will be resolved on self.

9.3 Running the App
===================

Type the command 'open Controller.app' on the command line in the
project directory.  Once the application has started it should look very
much like the first application.  Select the "Open" button from the Menu
and you should see the second window pop up, now choose close, this will
call the method "closeWindow:" which should cause the window to
disappear.

10 Advanced Topics
******************

This section will cover some topics which won't be of general interest
to most users.  The details in this section pertain to the internal
workings of Gorm.

10.1 Gorm file format
=====================

The current Gorm file format is basically just a set of objects, encoded
one after another in a continuous stream with some markers indicating
when a new class starts or which class is encoded.

10.1.1 The Name Table
---------------------

Each object in the .gorm file has a name assigned to it by the
application.  This allows Gorm to refer to the objects by a name once
they are loaded rather than an address.  Each name is associated with
it's object in a dictionary which preserves the overall structure of the
GUI which has been created.

10.1.2 The Custom Class Table
-----------------------------

This is only used when the user has associated a custom class with an
existing instance in the gorm file.  If the user has, for instance,
added an NSWindow to the gorm, he/she can use the custom class inspector
to select a subclass of NSWindow to change to.

10.1.3 Connections Array
------------------------

This array is used to form the connections after the .gorm file is
loaded.  The method '[... establishConnection]' is never called on
either NSNibControlConnector or NSNibOutletConnector objects while in
Gorm.  This prevents the connections from having any effect while they
are being edited in Gorm itself.  Once they are loaded, the
establishConnection method is called and the connections are made.

10.2 Custom Class Encoding
==========================

Custom objects are an interesting challenge in Gorm.  By definition,
custom classes are not known to Gorm, unless they are in a palette
(covered elsewhere).  For classes which are not in a palette instances
of these classes in Gorm are encoding in one of three ways:

   * A Proxy - This is a standin object which takes the place of the
     custom object.  This is usually used when the superclass of the
     object is a non-graphical object, such as a controller.  The init
     message is called on this object when it's unarchived.
   * A Custom View - This is a standin view object similar to the one
     descrribed above, but it is a subclass of NSView.  When this is
     used the initWithFrame: message is called on the view instance
     which is created (based on what view subclass the user selects)
   * A Template - Probably the most interesting of the three.  This is a
     standin class which uses an existing instance created in Gorm to
     build a custom subclass from.  For instance when a window subclass
     is created, call it MyWindow, a template class called
     GSWindowTemplate is used to hold the NSWindow created in Gorm as
     well as the name of the subclass to be created when the class is
     unarchived outside of Gorm as well as some additional information.
     When the classes are unarchived in the running app, the designated
     initializer for that class will be invoked, except in the case of
     NSControl subclasses.  See the Apple documentation for more
     information.

   All custom instances have awakeFromNib invoked on them when they are
unarchived from the .gorm file.  This allows the user to do whatever
additional setup that needs to be done, such as setting attribute.
Classes which are "known" are, of course, directly encoded into the
.gorm file.

10.2.1 Restrictions On Your Custom Subclasses
---------------------------------------------

The restrictions here are the same as those in Apple's InterfaceBuilder.
In general, you cannot have additional information which is expected to
be decoded in an initWithCoder: method from a custom class which uses
one of the methods in the previous section.  This is because, by
definition, Gorm doesn't know anything about these classes and allowing
you to use them in Gorm in this way is a convenience to make it simpler
for the developer.  Gorm therefore, must use one of the proxies to
encode the class since it cannot encode the class directly.

   How can you get your classes into Gorm, you say?  I'm pleased that
you asked me that question.  The best way to make your class known to
Gorm so that you don't need to worry about the above restriction is to
add a palette which contains your class.  In this way, because you're
literally linking the class into Gorm, you're making the class and it's
structure known to Gorm so that it can encode the class directly.  With
the new palette loaded you can load and save classes containing real
instances, not proxies, of your class encoded directly in the .gorm
file.  How to create a palette is discussed at length in the following
section.

10.3 Palettes
=============

10.3.1 Graphical Objects In A Palette
-------------------------------------

You are, by now, familiar with the built in palettes which are provided
with Gorm.  Palettes are a powerful feature which allows the developer
to add his/her own objects to Gorm.  It is possible for a developer to
write custom inspectors, editors and palettes for use with Gorm.  A good
example of a custom palette is palettetest in the dev-apps/test in the
GNUstep distribution.  Assuming you don't have that, however, I will
explain precisely what you need to do in order to create a simple
palette.  The entire process is very short and suprisingly simple.
First open Gorm and selection Gorm->Document->New Module->New Palette.
This will create a palette sized window.  Once that's done go to the
classes view in the main document window and find "IBPalette" in the
class list.  Create a subclass of that, the name can be whatever you
want.  For the purposes of our example we'll call it MyPalette.  Drag a
custom view to the window and choose the class you would like to add to
the palette from one of your custom classes.

   Once you've done this, generate the code for the classes (discussed
in previous chapters).  In the code, you'll add a method called "-(void)
finishInstantiate" leave it empty for now.  In the makefile for the
palette make sure that the library or framework the view comes from is
linked with the palette.  Now build the palette.

   After the palette is built you're ready to load it into Gorm.  Go to
the preferences panel and go to "Palettes".  This should bring up a
table view.  Click on add.  You should see a open dialog open.  Select
the palette bundle with this.  If the palette is successfully loaded,
you should see the name appear in the list.  One thing to note here.
Once a palette is loaded, it can't be unloaded until you close and
restart Gorm.  This is because by loading the palette bundle, the code
in the bundle is being linked into Gorm.  This can't be undone, once
it's done.

   Now, you should see the palette in the set of palettes in the palette
window.  Simply scroll over to it and select it's icon.  When you do
this, you should see the view that you set up using the custom view
displayed as an actual instance.  Note that we used one of the
techniques listed above, it is possible to use any of the three for any
object you add to your palette.  You can now drag the view from the
palette to a new window.

10.3.2 Non Graphical Objects In A Palette
-----------------------------------------

You may recall the creation of a method called "-(void)
finishInstantiate" in the previous section.  This section will make full
use of that method.  Re-open the palette you created before, but this
time add an image view to the window.  Then add to the image view, the
icon you want to represent the non-graphical object.  Here you'll need
to add an ivar to the MyPalette class in both Gorm and in your source
code called, imageView.  Once you've done this make the connection
between the image view and it's ivar.

   Assuming that the class is called "NonUIObject", in finish
instantiate, you'll need to add the following line of code:

   id obj = [NonUIObject new];

   [self associateObject: obj	type: IBObjectPboardType	with: imageView];

   This code has the effect of associating the non-ui object with the ui
object you just added to represent it.  When you drag and drop the
element which prepresents the object to something, it will copy the
object, not the ui element, to the destination.

   Congratulations, you now know how Palettes work.

11 Frequently Asked Questions
*****************************

11.1 Should I modify the data.classes of file in the .gorm package?
===================================================================

My advice is never to do this, ever.  Some have said that "they're plain
text and I should be able to change them".  My response to this rather
loosely pronounced and weak rationale is that if they are modified I
cannot and will not guarantee that Gorm will be able to read them or
will function correctly if it does.

11.2 Why does my application crash when I add additional attributes for encoding in encodeWithCoder: or initWithCoder: in my custom class?
==========================================================================================================================================

If you've selected the custom class by clicking on an existing object
and then selecting a subclass in the Custom Class Inspector in Gorm's
inspector panel, then when the .gorm file is saved, Gorm must use what
is called a template to take the place of the class so that when the
.gorm is unarchived in the running application, the template can become
the custom subclass you specified.  Gorm has no way of knowing about the
additional attributes of your subclass, so when it's archived the
template depends on the encodeWithCoder: of the existing class.  Also,
when AppKit loads the .gorm file, the initWithCoder: on the subclass is
called to allow the user to do any actions, except for additional
encoding, which need to be done at that time.  This is particularly true
when non-keyed coding is used, since, with keyed coding, it's possible
to skip keys that are not present.  The application may not crash if
keyed coding is used, but Gorm would still not know about the additional
attributes and would not be able to persist them anyway.

   Please see information in previous chapters regarding palettes, if
you would like to be able to add your classes to Gorm so that they don't
need to be replaced by templates, or proxy objects.

11.3 Why does Gorm give me a warning when I have bundles specified in GSAppKitUserBundles?
==========================================================================================

Some bundles may use poseAs: to affect change in the existing behavior
of some GNUstep classes.  The poseAs: method causes an issue which may
cause Gorm to incorrectly encode the class name for the object which was
replaced.  This makes the resulting .gorm file unusable when another
user who is not using the same bundle attempts to load it.

11.4 How can I avoid loading GSAppKitUserBundles in Gorm?
=========================================================

You need to write to Gorm's defaults like this:

   ' defaults write Gorm GSAppKitUserBundles '()' '

   Doing this overrides the settings in NSGlobalDomain for Gorm and
forces Gorm not to load any user bundles at all.  To eliminate this
simply do:

   ' defaults delete Gorm GSAppKitUserBundles '

11.5 How can I change the font for a widget?
============================================

This is a simple two step process.  Select the window the widget is in
and then select the widget itself, then bring up the font panel by
hitting Command-t (or by choosing the menu item).  By doing this you're
making the window the main window and by selecting the widget, you're
telling the editor for that object to accept changes.  Then you can
select the font in the panel and hit "Set".  For some objects, the font
panel isn't effective because those objects can't have a font directly
set.
