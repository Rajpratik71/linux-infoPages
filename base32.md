3.5 ‘base32’: Transform data into printable data
================================================

‘base32’ transforms data read from a file, or standard input, into (or
from) base32 encoded form.  The base32 encoded form uses printable ASCII
characters to represent binary data.  The usage and options of this
command are precisely the same as for ‘base64’.  *Note base64
