NAME
       lxc - linux containers

OVERVIEW
       The  container  technology  is actively being pushed into the mainstream Linux kernel. It pro‐
       vides resource management through control groups and resource isolation via namespaces.

       lxc, aims to use these new functionalities to provide a userspace container object which  pro‐
       vides full resource isolation and resource control for an applications or a full system.

       lxc is small enough to easily manage a container with simple command lines and complete enough
       to be used for other purposes.

REQUIREMENTS
       The kernel version >= 3.10 shipped with the distros, will work with lxc, this  one  will  have
       less functionalities but enough to be interesting.

       lxc relies on a set of functionalities provided by the kernel. The helper script lxc-checkcon‐
       fig will give you information about your kernel configuration, required, and missing features.

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION
       A container is an object isolating some resources of the host, for the application  or  system
       running in it.

       The application / system will be launched inside a container specified by a configuration that
       is either initially created or passed as a parameter of the commands.

       How to run an application in a container

       Before running an application, you should know what are the resources you want to isolate. The
       default  configuration is to isolate PIDs, the sysv IPC and mount points. If you want to run a
       simple shell inside a container, a basic configuration is needed, especially if  you  want  to
       share  the  rootfs. If you want to run an application like sshd, you should provide a new net‐
       work stack and  a  new  hostname.  If  you  want  to  avoid  conflicts  with  some  files  eg.
       /var/run/httpd.pid,  you should remount /var/run with an empty directory. If you want to avoid
       the conflicts in all the cases, you can specify a rootfs for the container. The rootfs can  be
       a  directory  tree, previously bind mounted with the initial rootfs, so you can still use your
       distro but with your own /etc and /home

       Here is an example of directory tree for sshd:

       [root@lxc sshd]$ tree -d rootfs

       rootfs
       |-- bin
       |-- dev
       |   |-- pts
       |   `-- shm
       |       `-- network
       |-- etc
       |   `-- ssh
       |-- lib
       |-- proc
       |-- root
       |-- sbin
       |-- sys
       |-- usr
       `-- var
           |-- empty
           |   `-- sshd
           |-- lib
           |   `-- empty
           |       `-- sshd
           `-- run
               `-- sshd

       and the mount points file associated with it:

            [root@lxc sshd]$ cat fstab

            /lib /home/root/sshd/rootfs/lib none ro,bind 0 0
            /bin /home/root/sshd/rootfs/bin none ro,bind 0 0
            /usr /home/root/sshd/rootfs/usr none ro,bind 0 0
            /sbin /home/root/sshd/rootfs/sbin none ro,bind 0 0

       How to run a system in a container

       Running a system inside a container is paradoxically easier than running an application.  Why?
       Because you don't have to care about the resources to be isolated, everything needs to be iso‐
       lated, the other resources are specified as being isolated but without  configuration  because
       the  container  will  set  them up. eg. the ipv4 address will be setup by the system container
       init scripts. Here is an example of the mount points file:

            [root@lxc debian]$ cat fstab

            /dev /home/root/debian/rootfs/dev none bind 0 0
            /dev/pts /home/root/debian/rootfs/dev/pts  none bind 0 0

   CONTAINER LIFE CYCLE
       When the container is created, it contains the configuration information. When  a  process  is
       launched, the container will be starting and running. When the last process running inside the
       container exits, the container is stopped.

       In case of failure when the container is initialized, it will pass through the aborting state.

               ---------------------

   CONFIGURATION
       The container is configured through a configuration file, the format of the configuration file
       is described in lxc.conf(5)

   CREATING / DESTROYING CONTAINERS
       A  persistent container object can be created via the lxc-create command. It takes a container
       name as parameter and optional configuration file and template. The name is used by  the  dif‐
       ferent commands to refer to this container. The lxc-destroy command will destroy the container
       object.

              lxc-create -n foo
              lxc-destroy -n foo

   VOLATILE CONTAINER
       It is not mandatory to create a container object before starting it.   The  container  can  be
       directly started with a configuration file as parameter.

   STARTING / STOPPING CONTAINER
       When  the  container has been created, it is ready to run an application / system. This is the
       purpose of the lxc-execute and lxc-start commands. If the container  was  not  created  before
       starting the application, the container will use the configuration file passed as parameter to
       the command, and if there is no such parameter either, then it will use a  default  isolation.
       If  the  application  ended, the container will be stopped, but if needed the lxc-stop command
       can be used to stop the container.

       Running an application inside a container is not exactly the same thing as running  a  system.
       For this reason, there are two different commands to run an application into a container:

              lxc-execute -n foo [-f config] /bin/bash
              lxc-start -n foo [-f config] [/bin/bash]

       The  lxc-execute  command  will run the specified command into a container via an intermediate
       process, lxc-init.  This lxc-init after launching the specified command, will wait for its end
       and  all other reparented processes. (to support daemons in the container). In other words, in
       the container, lxc-init has PID 1 and the first process of the application has PID 2.

       The lxc-start command will directly run the specified command in the container. The PID of the
       first  process  is  1.  If  no  command is specified lxc-start will run the command defined in
       lxc.init.cmd or if not set, /sbin/init .

       To summarize, lxc-execute is for running an application and lxc-start  is  better  suited  for
       running a system.

       If  the  application  is  no  longer  responding,  is inaccessible or is not able to finish by
       itself, a wild lxc-stop command will kill all the processes in the container without pity.

              lxc-stop -n foo -k

   CONNECT TO AN AVAILABLE TTY
       If the container is configured with ttys, it is possible to access it through them. It  is  up
       to  the container to provide a set of available ttys to be used by the following command. When
       the tty is lost, it is possible to reconnect to it without login again.

              lxc-console -n foo -t 3

   FREEZE / UNFREEZE CONTAINER
       Sometime, it is useful to stop all the processes belonging to a container, eg. for job  sched‐
       uling. The commands:

              lxc-freeze -n foo

       will put all the processes in an uninteruptible state and

              lxc-unfreeze -n foo

       will resume them.

       This feature is enabled if the freezer cgroup v1 controller is enabled in the kernel.

   GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT CONTAINER
       When  there  are a lot of containers, it is hard to follow what has been created or destroyed,
       what is running or what are the PIDs running in a specific container.  For  this  reason,  the
       following commands may be useful:

              lxc-ls -f
              lxc-info -n foo

       lxc-ls lists containers.

       lxc-info gives information for a specific container.

       Here  is  an  example on how the combination of these commands allows one to list all the con‐
       tainers and retrieve their state.

              for i in $(lxc-ls -1); do
                lxc-info -n $i
              done

   MONITORING CONTAINER
       It is sometime useful to track the states of a container, for example to monitor it or just to
       wait for a specific state in a script.

       lxc-monitor  command  will  monitor  one  or several containers. The parameter of this command
       accepts a regular expression for example:

              lxc-monitor -n "foo|bar"

       will monitor the states of containers named 'foo' and 'bar', and:

              lxc-monitor -n ".*"

       will monitor all the containers.

       For a container 'foo' starting, doing some work and exiting, the output will be in the form:

              'foo' changed state to [STARTING]
              'foo' changed state to [RUNNING]
              'foo' changed state to [STOPPING]
              'foo' changed state to [STOPPED]

       lxc-wait command will wait for a specific state change and exit. This is useful for  scripting
       to  synchronize  the launch of a container or the end. The parameter is an ORed combination of
       different states. The following example shows how to wait for a container if  it  successfully
       started as a daemon.

              # launch lxc-wait in background
              lxc-wait -n foo -s STOPPED &
              LXC_WAIT_PID=$!

              # this command goes in background
              lxc-execute -n foo mydaemon &

              # block until the lxc-wait exits
              # and lxc-wait exits when the container
              # is STOPPED
              wait $LXC_WAIT_PID
              echo "'foo' is finished"

   CGROUP SETTINGS FOR CONTAINERS
       The  container is tied with the control groups, when a container is started a control group is
       created and associated with it. The control group properties can be read and modified when the
       container is running by using the lxc-cgroup command.

       lxc-cgroup  command is used to set or get a control group subsystem which is associated with a
       container. The subsystem name is handled by the user, the command won't do any syntax checking
       on the subsystem name, if the subsystem name does not exists, the command will fail.

              lxc-cgroup -n foo cpuset.cpus

       will display the content of this subsystem.

              lxc-cgroup -n foo cpu.shares 512

       will set the subsystem to the specified value.
