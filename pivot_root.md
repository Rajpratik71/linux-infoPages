NAME
       pivot_root - change the root filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       pivot_root new_root put_old

DESCRIPTION
       pivot_root  moves  the  root file system of the current process to the directory put_old and makes new_root the new root file system.  Since pivot_root(8) simply calls pivot_root(2), we refer to
       the man page of the latter for further details.

       Note that, depending on the implementation of pivot_root, root and cwd of the caller may or may not change. The following is a sequence for invoking pivot_root that works in either case,  assum‚Äê
       ing that pivot_root and chroot are in the current PATH:

       cd new_root
       pivot_root . put_old
       exec chroot . command

       Note that chroot must be available under the old root and under the new root, because pivot_root may or may not have implicitly changed the root directory of the shell.

       Note  that  exec  chroot  changes the running executable, which is necessary if the old root directory should be unmounted afterwards.  Also note that standard input, output, and error may still
       point to a device on the old root file system, keeping it busy. They can easily be changed when invoking chroot (see below; note the absence of leading slashes to make it work whether pivot_root
       has changed the shell's root or not).

OPTIONS
       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Change the root file system to /dev/hda1 from an interactive shell:

       mount /dev/hda1 /new-root
       cd /new-root
       pivot_root . old-root
       exec chroot . sh <dev/console >dev/console 2>&1
       umount /old-root

       Mount the new root file system over NFS from 10.0.0.1:/my_root and run init:

       ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up   # for portmap
       # configure Ethernet or such
       portmap   # for lockd (implicitly started by mount)
       mount -o ro 10.0.0.1:/my_root /mnt
       killall portmap   # portmap keeps old root busy
       cd /mnt
       pivot_root . old_root
       exec chroot . sh -c 'umount /old_root; exec /sbin/init' \
         <dev/console >dev/console 2>&1

NAME
       pivot_root - change the root filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       int pivot_root(const char *new_root, const char *put_old);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       pivot_root() moves the root filesystem of the calling process to the directory put_old and makes new_root the new root filesystem of the calling process.

       The  typical  use  of  pivot_root() is during system startup, when the system mounts a temporary root filesystem (e.g., an initrd), then mounts the real root filesystem, and eventually turns the
       latter into the current root of all relevant processes or threads.

       pivot_root() may or may not change the current root and the current working directory of any processes or threads which use the old root directory.  The caller of pivot_root() must  ensure  that
       processes  with  root or current working directory at the old root operate correctly in either case.  An easy way to ensure this is to change their root and current working directory to new_root
       before invoking pivot_root().

       The paragraph above is intentionally vague because the implementation of pivot_root() may change in the future.  At the time of writing, pivot_root() changes root and current  working  directory
       of  each process or thread to new_root if they point to the old root directory.  This is necessary in order to prevent kernel threads from keeping the old root directory busy with their root and
       current working directory, even if they never access the filesystem in any way.  In the future, there may be a mechanism for kernel threads to explicitly relinquish any access to the filesystem,
       such that this fairly intrusive mechanism can be removed from pivot_root().

       Note  that  this  also  applies  to  the  calling  process:  pivot_root()  may  or may not affect its current working directory.  It is therefore recommended to call chdir("/") immediately after
       pivot_root().

       The following restrictions apply to new_root and put_old:

       -  They must be directories.

       -  new_root and put_old must not be on the same filesystem as the current root.

       -  put_old must be underneath new_root, that is, adding a nonzero number of /.. to the string pointed to by put_old must yield the same directory as new_root.

       -  No other filesystem may be mounted on put_old.

       See also pivot_root(8) for additional usage examples.

       If the current root is not a mount point (e.g., after chroot(2) or pivot_root(), see also below), not the old root directory, but the mount point of that filesystem is mounted on put_old.

       new_root does not have to be a mount point.  In this case, /proc/mounts will show the mount point of the filesystem containing new_root as root (/).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       pivot_root() may return (in errno) any of the errors returned by stat(2).  Additionally, it may return:

       EBUSY  new_root or put_old are on the current root filesystem, or a filesystem is already mounted on put_old.

       EINVAL put_old is not underneath new_root.

       ENOTDIR
              new_root or put_old is not a directory.

       EPERM  The calling process does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

VERSIONS
       pivot_root() was introduced in Linux 2.3.41.

CONFORMING TO
       pivot_root() is Linux-specific and hence is not portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it using syscall(2).

BUGS
       pivot_root() should not have to change root and current working directory of all other processes in the system.

       Some of the more obscure uses of pivot_root() may quickly lead to insanity.
