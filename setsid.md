NAME
       setsid - run a program in a new session

SYNOPSIS
       setsid [options] program [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       setsid  runs  a program in a new session. The command calls fork(2) if already a process group leader.  Otherwise, it executes a program in the current process.  This default behavior is possible to
       override by the --fork option.

OPTIONS
       -c, --ctty
              Set the controlling terminal to the current one.

       -f, --fork
              Always create a new process.

       -w, --wait
              Wait for the execution of the program to end, and return the exit value of this program as the return value of setsid.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

NAME
       setsid - creates a session and sets the process group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t setsid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       setsid()  creates a new session if the calling process is not a process group leader.  The calling process is the leader of the new session (i.e., its session ID is made the same as its process ID).
       The calling process also becomes the process group leader of a new process group in the session (i.e., its process group ID is made the same as its process ID).

       The calling process will be the only process in the new process group and in the new session.

       Initially, the new session has no controlling terminal.  For details of how a session acquires a controlling terminal, see credentials(7).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the (new) session ID of the calling process is returned.  On error, (pid_t) -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EPERM  The process group ID of any process equals the PID of the calling process.  Thus, in particular, setsid() fails if the calling process is already a process group leader.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4.

NOTES
       A child created via fork(2) inherits its parent's session ID.  The session ID is preserved across an execve(2).

       A process group leader is a process whose process group ID equals its PID.  Disallowing a process group leader from calling setsid() prevents the possibility that a process group leader  places  it‚Äê
       self  in a new session while other processes in the process group remain in the original session; such a scenario would break the strict two-level hierarchy of sessions and process groups.  In order
       to be sure that setsid() will succeed, call fork(2) and have the parent _exit(2), while the child (which by definition can't be a process group leader) calls setsid().

       If a session has a controlling terminal, and the CLOCAL flag for that terminal is not set, and a terminal hangup occurs, then the session leader is sent a SIGHUP signal.

       If a process that is a session leader terminates, then a SIGHUP signal is sent to each process in the foreground process group of the controlling terminal.
